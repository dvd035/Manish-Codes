Some project ideas I mean to implement some day

  - Tool that parallelizes `make`, or at least parallelized gcc compilations over similar machines by shuttling dependancies around and delegating tasks to each partially built system.
  - Python script to run on a cluster where instructions are pushed from node to node whenever they turn on
  - StackExchange moderator ping script
  - Integrate MathToTeX into StackExchange
   -nice
